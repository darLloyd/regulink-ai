Latest News on Regulation
Crypto regulation is an umbrella term for the network of laws, statutes and legal practices surrounding the crypto and blockchain industries. Since Bitcoin's 2008 white paper, the legal status of these industries has been the subject of a huge amount of conversation. Lawmakers and regulators have had to cope with an entirely new set of concerns. Some governments have reacted hostilely, seeing crypto as a threat to monetary control. Others have embraced the industry for its capacity to link distant economies and facilitate trustless transactions across the globe. But most of the world is still figuring out exactly how to legislate, regulate and prosecute the set of laws surrounding such a young industry.
